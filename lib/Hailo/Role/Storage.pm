=head1 NAME

Hailo::Role::Storage - A role representing a L<Hailo|Hailo> storage backend

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<order>

The Markov order (chain length) being used.

=head2 C<brain>

The name of the resource (file name, database name) to use as storage.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new>

This is the constructor. It accept the attributes specified in
L</ATTRIBUTES>.

=head2 C<save>

Saves the current state.

=head2 C<add_expr>

Adds a new expression. Takes the follwing arguments:

B<'tokens'>, an array reference of the tokens that make up the expression.
The number of elements should be equal to the value returned by
C<order|/order>.

B<'next_token'>, the token that succeeds this expression, if any.

B<'next_token'>, the token that precedes this expression, if any.

=head2 C<random_expr>

Takes a single token as an argument and returns a randomly picked expression
which contains it.

=head2 C<token_exists>

Takes a single token as an argument and returns a true value if the token
exists.

=head2 C<next_tokens>

Takes an array reference of tokens arguments that make up an expression and
returns a hash reference of tokens that may succeed it. The value is the
number of times the token has been seen succeeding the expression.

=head2 C<prev_tokens>

Takes an array reference of tokens arguments that make up an expression and
returns a hash reference of tokens that may precede it. The value is the
number of times the token has been seen preceding the expression.

=head2 C<start_learning>

Takes no arguments. This method is called by C<Hailo|Hailo> right before learning
begins.

=head2 C<stop_learning>

Takes no arguments. This method is called by C<Hailo|Hailo> right after learning
finishes.

=head2 C<start_training>

Takes no arguments. This method is called by C<Hailo|Hailo> right before training
begins.

=head2 C<stop_training>

Takes no arguments. This method is called by C<Hailo|Hailo> right after training
finishes.
