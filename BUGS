* Save Tokenizer setting to the database

We only save the order and not the tokenizer to the database. Save it
and warn if the user tries to use it like e.g. this:

    hailo --train file.trn --brain file.sqlite --tokenizer Chars
    hailo --brain file.sqlite --tokenizer Words --reply foo

* Add utils/random-names to synopsis/usage example

This is a very useful and easy to show use case of Hailo.

* Show Bot::Training in --help output

Getting started with e.g. the MegaHAL training file is nice.

* Don't pass the DBI connection string with --storage-args

There's lots of per-driver syntax in the DBI connection string that we
don't support. We don't support the MySQL syntax for reading auth
details from ~/.my.cnf for example.

Make Hailo be used like this:

    hailo --brain file-or-db-name

And extended use like this:

    hailo --connect dbi:SQLite:dbname=file.sqlite

And for user/pass:

    hailo --connect='["dbi:SQLite:my.db", "", ""]'

See what dbicadmin(1) does.

--brain wolud then be optional when --connect is supplied.

* Add a looping ->reply() Engine backend

Extend the Default engine so that it supports a looping
backend. MegaHAL loops for 1 second and cobe loops for 5 iterations
(with token scoring).

This will generate more surprising replies. Sometimes we spit the
input string unmodified or almost unmodified at the user.

* Markov order range

In the future we should modify Hailo to use Markov orders
1..$max_order. I.e. if the user sets $max_order to 5, expressions of
all lengths up to and including 5 should be created. This should
vastly improve responses, but it might increase the size of the brain
quite a bit.

* Add some sort of logging

Something of the 'DEBUG "foo"' variety so the logging can be compiled
out at BEGIN time if it's not needed.

* Use grammars in the Word tokenizer

Words.pm uses a few hacky regexes to capitalize words. It needs quite
a bit of context to decide which words to capitalize, so it does it in
three passes. It might be more efficient to use some of 5.10's grammar
features instead. -hinrik

    I tried this at one point and I got some errors which indicated
    internal errors in the regex engine. Perhaps I was doing something
    wrong. -avar

* Add an --init switch / init sub to storage engines

The _engage sub in Storage.pm can't be called standalone. It would be
useful to make storage engines init the database but not import
anything, to e.g. init Pg and then import into it efficiently using
hacky means (like feeding it a sqlite dump).

    I've now added ->initialized which is 1/2 of this -avar
